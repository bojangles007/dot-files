I just sent this email to test that sending email to
$1@laterpay.net works.

To complete setup of your account and send emails as
$1@laterpay.net rather than $2@laterpay.ag you need to do
the following:

1. Click the "cog" in the upper right corner of Gmail
2. Click the "settings" menu item
3. Click the "Accounts" tab that shows up. This will be roughly in the
   middle of the screen, at the top.
4. If $1@laterpay.net is not in the list of accounts, add it by clicking the
   "Add another email address that you own" link.
5. In the "Send mail as" section, click the "make default" option next
   to $1@laterpay.net.

Please send me a reply so I can verify the setup works, and many
apologies for the inconvenience!

Your friendly sysadmin,

Stig
