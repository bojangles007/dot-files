I just sent this email to test that sending email to
$1@laterpay.net works.

To complete setup of your account and send emails as
$1@laterpay.net rather than $2@laterpay.ag you need to do
the following:

1. Click the "cog" in the upper right corner of Gmail
2. Click the "settings" menu item
3. Click the "Accounts" tab that shows up. This will be roughly in the
   middle of the screen, at the top.
4. In the "Send mail as" section, click the "make default" option next
   to $1@laterpay.net.

Your friendly sysadmin,

Stig
